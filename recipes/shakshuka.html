        Heat the oil in a frying pan that has a lid, then soften the onions,
        chilli, garlic and coriander stalks for 5 mins until soft. Stir in the
        tomatoes and sugar, then bubble for 8-10 mins until thick. Can be frozen

        Using the back of a large spoon, make 4 dips in the sauce, then crack an
        egg into each one. Put a lid on the pan, then cook over a low heat for
        6-8 mins, until the eggs are done to your liking. Scatter with the
        coriander leaves and serve with crusty bread.
